    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>A lot of the music I enjoy come from late 2000s and early 2010s. There have been songs more recently that I've enjoyed greatly as well. Some of the artists I enjoy are listed below.</p>
    <h2>Avicii</h2>
    <p>Avicii's music is always going to have a special place in my heart just because his music was very apparent in my childhood. RIP.</p>
